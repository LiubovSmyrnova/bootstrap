            <p>Farrell was purchased as a premium stallion at the Hannoveraner Verband’s 2013 licensing and was subsequently approved as a premium stallion for Danish Warmbloods in 2014. Unfortunately, he broke a leg after that breeding season and was thus prevented from passing the 35-day test, which meant he could not get his approval renewed for 2015. He successfully recovered and returned as a 4-year-old to pass the 35-day test in autumn 2015 with 856.5 points, including 9 for trot and 9.5 in rideability.</p>

            <p>He was licensed by the KWPN in 2018 and passed the KWPN’s 50-day test in Ermelo the same year with an excellent result, securing him second place in dressage.

Statement from the 50-day trial in Ermelo. Scored 95,40 points at the Danish Young Horse Championship Qualifier for 5-yo's with a 10 for trot.

            <p>In continuation of the licensing the approved stallions were enrolled for the 10-day observation test where Monte Carlo earned very positive comments from the judges:– Very willing to work, rideable and energetic stallion. His walk is energetic and with a clear beat. The trot is elastic, energetic and supple with good self-carriage and push off the ground. The canter is ground covering and elastic with good self-carriage.
                For his KWPN performance test in 2020 he placed as no. 2 with the marks 9 for walk, 8,5 for trot, 9 for canter, 8,5 for suppleness, 8,5 for posture and balance, 8,5 for ridability and interior – as well as a 9 for capacity!</p>
